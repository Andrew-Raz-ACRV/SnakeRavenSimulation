# SnakeRavenSimulation
A MATLAB simulation of SnakeRaven and its kinematics control functions

# How to use this code:
Running the main file in the MATLAB command window:
```
>> RavenSnakeBotControl
```
A figure shows a render of the Snake-part of SnakeRaven moving from an initial pose towards a final pose
There are settings in the main file to record the motion as a .gif file or adjust the control settings.
